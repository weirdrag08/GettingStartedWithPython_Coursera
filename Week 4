# 2.2 Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. 
# Note that input will pop up a dialog box. Enter Sarah in the pop-up box when you are prompted so your output will match the desired output.



# The code below almost works

name = input("Enter your name")
print("Hello", name)







# 2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay.
# Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25).
# You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.


# This first line is provided for you

hrs = float(input("Enter Hours:"))
rph = float(input("Enter the rate per hour value:"))
pay = hrs * rph
print("Pay:",pay)
